== Deployment

Deployment of the {project-short-name} consists of deploying all necessary
dependencies and then the module itself into OpenMRS.

You need to login to your OpenMRS instance as administrative user and go to the
Administration, Manage Modules page and add the modules shown in the following
sections.

=== Module Dependencies

The {project-short-name} currently depends on the
https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-emrapi[OpenMRS EMRAPI Module] version
{openmrs-dependency-emrapi-version} which itself has a bunch of dependencies.

You can get the dependencies at {openmrs-modulus-url}[OpenMRS modules].

The following list is a suggested order in which we have managed to
successfully deploy the necessary dependencies:

1. providermanagement - version 2.3
2. uiframework - version 3.4
3. uilibrary - version 1.5
4. emrapi - version {openmrs-dependency-emrapi-version}
5. event - version 2.2.1
6. reporting - version 0.9.8.1
7. htmlwidgets - version 1.7.0
8. calculation - version 1.1
9. serialization.xstream - version 0.2.9
10. metadatasharing - version 1.1.9
11. metadatamapping - version 1.0.1

NOTE: Do not worry about alerts you might get due to a modules dependencies not
being met. Just go ahead and deploy its dependencies and hit the start
button of the module which created the alert. You might also be able to add
newer versions of the modules listed here.

=== Module Package

Since there has not been an official release yet you need to compile the
{project-short-name} yourself.

Please follow the instructions at {project-source-code}.
